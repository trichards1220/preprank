"""Ingest game-by-game results CSV and build the data structures needed by the engine.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.ingest_game_results data/game_results/2025_football_game_results.csv

CSV columns:
    season_year, week, team_name, opponent_name, team_score, opponent_score,
    is_home, is_district, opponent_division, opponent_select_status

The ingestion does the following:
1. Reads every row as one team's perspective of a game
2. Builds TeamRecord objects with win/loss totals derived from the data
3. Builds GameResult lists per team
4. Cross-references opponent records from the seed CSV (data/seed/) for
   teams not in the game results file (out-of-state, other brackets, etc.)
5. Returns structures ready for calculate_all_power_ratings()

Design decision: Each row is ONE team's view. If you have both teams' perspectives
in the file, duplicates are detected and collapsed. If you only have one side,
the opponent's game is inferred automatically.
